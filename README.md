Work for the final project of Information Visualization; the [2017 MC1 VAST challenge](https://www.ieeevis.org/year/2017/info/overview-amp-topics/vast-challenge-program) using D3.

This code aims to analyze and find unusual activity by visitors to a nature park. To do so, my D3 analysis focuses on visualizing paths taken through the park, both overlayed onto the map and as a live view with estimated vehicle positions.

The .js implements sorting by vehicle type and date/time range, and also allows for hovering over routes to see route statistics.

To see it in action, see https://ryh9.github.io/infovis/

Most of my work is in mcroutes1.js, and the index.html document attached is meant to be launched as a website.
